--->all the modules with type definition are needed as a part of development
    so intsall them as a devdependencies  npm i @types/modules
--->but still we need the regular npm modules for production which is used by the js files

--->explicity type the process.env in src/types/env.d.ts
    ```
    declare namespace NodeJS {
        interface ProcessEnv {
            mongodb_connection_URl: string; // Add the environment variable with its type
        }
    }
    ```
if not all the .env variables are not identified by the ts so use fallback value 
    ```await mongoose.connect(mongoUrl || ''); ```

--->Do not push the js files to the git hub during deployment using ```tsc ``` js files 
    are generated ony push .ts to the github
